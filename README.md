# Parking Spot Finder
In today’s fast-paced infrastructures, efficient parking management is required for a more easier day-to-day basis. The importance of easily accessible and well-organised parking facilities goes beyond just basic convenience, it is an important factor in a more steady urban life. The purpose of this research is to reduce the time needed for people to find parking slots and ease the process in general. Our system is designed for parking spaces equipped with cutting-edge sensor technology, redefining how users engage with and benefit from these sensor-equipped parking spaces. This project’s setting is especially significant for malls and offices with a significant amount of parking spaces. Since they may encounter challenges in creating an efficient environment for the parking system.
